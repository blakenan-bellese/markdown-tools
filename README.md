## Description ##

There are times when one would like to use Google Docs as a collaborative
markdown editor, given all of the comment and suggest features that are native
to Google Docs. However, Google Docs is missing the ability to automatically add
section / heading  numbers and automatically create a table of contents. This
add-on addresses those two missing features.

This means that one can still use the Google Docs heading styles to make the
document pretty to read while editing, but then also allow one to automatically
add heading numbers and the required hash marks at the start of each heading.
This add-on can also create a table of contents (TOC). The TOC would be created
/ added after the headings have all been numbered. 

In addition to adding "markdown heading numbers" you can also use this tool to
add plain heading numbers. I added support for that since Google Docs is
fundamentally missing that feature. 

I may add additional markdown features to this add-on over time. Suggestions and
 code/feature additions are welcome.
