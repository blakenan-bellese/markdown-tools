	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Markdown Tools is a simple Google Doc add-on which will add heading numbers
	to the normal headings/styles in a Google docs document. Optionally, it can add
	the heading numbers along with the markdown hash tags that are appropriate for
	each heading level. This tool can also create and add a markdown styled table
	of contents to the document where the cursor is currently located.</p>

	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p>This add-on runs client side. No information is collected or shared by this
	add-on. Using this add-on means granting access to the current open Google Docs
	document and allowing the add-on to look for headings and insert heading
	numbers and a table of contents.</p>
